Guide Your Trip is an AI-powered travel chatbot web application that
helps users explore cities effortlessly. By entering a city name, users
instantly receive curated information such as a brief description, top tourist
attractions, popular local foods, nearby shopping malls, and recommended
restaurants.Built with Python and Flask, the app offers a lightweight yet
efficient backend. It integrates external APIs like Wikipedia for city
descriptions and OpenAIâ€™s language models (via OpenRouter API) to
generate smart travel recommendations. Using natural language processing
(NLP), the chatbot interprets user queries and responds in an engaging,
conversational manner. What sets this project apart is its ability to deliver
real-time, structured, and relevant data, eliminating the need for manual
research. It also provides Google Maps links for each destination,
improving user convenience. This tool showcases the power of AI, NLP,
and web development in solving practical problems like travel
planning.Future features may include personalized itineraries, multilingual
support, real-time event updates, and booking service integration, making it
a strong foundation for next-gen travel solutions.
